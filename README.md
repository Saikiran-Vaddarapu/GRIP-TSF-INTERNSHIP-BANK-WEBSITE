# GRIP-TSF-INTERNSHIP-BANK-WEBSITE
As a part of the internship, I've created a dynamic website that facilitates the user to transact amounts between multiple accounts.
Also I've created a feature that shows the transaction history at any instance.
And the website was developed using HTML,CSS,JSP,JDBC and also taking MYSQL database as support.
